Hi everyone, we are Team Norman Borlaug! Our members include:

**Topic & Goals**: Our project will be focusing on Eastern African nations, Uganda and Tanzania, and evaluating the most efficient policies to minimize inefficiencies. In our code, we compare the nutritional deficiencies across the two nations, and have created policy implementations based off of this. GMOS, food fortification of targeted foods and vitamins maximize the nutritional rates of both populations. 

**Conclusions**: Our research is a strong recommendation for GMO-positive policies in Eastern Africa. In fact, we simulate 6 different GMO policies, resulting in the following Kaldor-Hicks improvements in Nutritional Outcomes:
- Vitamin C Nutritional Improvements: +51.95% Population Meeting RDI
- Protein Nutritional Improvements: +10.37% Population Meeting RDI
- Folate Policy 1 Nutritional Improvements: +39.25% Population Meeting RDI
- Folate Policy 2 Nutritional Improvements: +62.43% Population Meeting RDI
- Thiamin Nutritional Improvements: +14.81% Population Meeting RDI
- Vitamin B12 Nutritional Improvements: +10.38% Population Meeting RDI
